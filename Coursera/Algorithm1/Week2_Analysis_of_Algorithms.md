This week, the lecturer introduced why and how to analyze algorithms.
First why we analyze algorithms:
1. predict performance
2. compare algorithms
3. provide guarantees
4. understand theoretical basis
And the primary practical reason is to avoid performance bugs.
To be able to solve a large practical input, our program should be not slow and running out of memory.
Then we learn a framework for predicting performance and comparing algorithms:
1. Observe some feature of the natural world
2. Hypothesize a model that is consistent with the observations
3. Predict events using the hypothesis
4. Verify the predictions by making further observations
5. Validate by repeating until the hypothesis and observations agree.
